API Requests:

1. HTTP Method - GET/POST/DELETE/PUT
2. URI - Base URL / Base Path
3. Payload - depends on what type http call
should be in JSON format starting and ending with { }
the payload format or schema provided by developers through API documentation (swagger)
4. Headers - we need to pass that info also while sending request
content-type = application/json -> That means in which format you are sending the payload
that metadata also goes to the rest server


In payload when we see objects - those key value pairs are related
and that's why they are grouped together inside an object

** In Maven dependency if scope is limited to test , that means you can use that
dependency under src/test, can't use in src/main. If Scope is not mentioned then
scope is global and dependency can be used anywhere globally.
